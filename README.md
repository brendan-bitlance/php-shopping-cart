# php-shopping-cart

Smaller sites that need to sell stuff usually need a shopping cart.

This component gives you that basic functionality.

You can: 1) add items,Â 2) update quantity and grouping, 3) apply tax and discounts, 4) calculate totals

There's no rendered HTML -- you can make the output look the way you want it :)


## Demo

Run index.php in a browser to see and interact with a dummy shopping cart.
